        <ul>
            <li>This game is a recreation of the "Wanted!" minigame from New Super Mario Bros. and Mario 64 DS. The gameplay end condition is functional, as clicking the wrong alien ends the game. Nothing happens yet if you click the correct alien.</li>
            <li>I still plan to add an indicator of the face that is currently the target, and a timer and score system. Please let me know if there are any other features you'd like to see added.</li>
            <li>Also the art assets for the aliens are original and I'm open to creating new art for those features.</li>
