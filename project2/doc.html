        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <p>I'm planning to create a tool for searching and sorting the latest sales on Steam. This will help Steam users get the best deals on games.</p>
        <p>This will be accomplished using the <a href="https://apidocs.cheapshark.com/">CheapShark API</a>.</p>
        <a href="concept.html">Proof-of-concept</a>
        <h1>Project Prototype</h1>
        <p>I have a working prototype of the project. The project has full functionality for calling the CheapShark API using controls to filter the results, and displaying the proper search results to the user.</p>
        <p>I am using <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">fontawesome.com</a> for the search icon and any other icons I may need.</p>
        <p>I am looking for feedback on the layout of the page. Ignoring the style (colors, font, etc.), I am seeking feedback and initial impressions on the layout to ensure nothing is confusing about the site's functionality.</p>
        <h1>Post-Feedback</h1>
        <p>After getting feedback from peers, they all seemed to agree that the layout of the content worked well. I did recieve a comment that the page felt too wide at full screen, so I gave it a maximum width of 1280 pixels and gave the site a background gradient.</p>
        <p>After implementing styling changes, specifically colors, fonts, and some sizing/padding updates, I continued to update the layout of the page. Mainly, I found a way to get a higher resolution thumbnail image from steam, so I increased the size of the thumbnail images in the table. This also increased readability on mobile device widths.</p>
        <p>I also recieved some feedback on the style from a friend who is a 4th year New Media Development student. He gave me some pointers that improved the page's alignment and spacing.</p>
        <h1>Resources</h1>
